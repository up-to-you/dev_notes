### Java Collections Framework

#### EnumSet
Efficient for Enums, since this type of set stores enums as an array of bits. It is possible due to predefined information about available Enum's sizes and order:

`Note that each enum type has a static values method that returns an array containing all of the values of the enum type in the order they are declared.`

For example: MyEnum {A, B, C, D, E} represents as [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. To compare it with another EnumSet, which contains MyEnum {A,D,E} [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] â€“ jvm should perform only single bitwise operation. Sure, this `O(1)` is much faster than `hashcode` computation.
